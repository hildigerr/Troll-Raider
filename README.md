This began as my first attempt at a 7drl. My main purpose was to learn to use curses.

I lost a baby-tooth chewing on this stuff: It was also the first time I attempted parsing textual datafiles.
When I began duplicating my parsing routine, I realized I should have made it generic. And then, I started thinking
about all the rest of the places I could reduce code duplication. I became overwelmed and didn't finish in 7 days.
In fact, it's still not done and has been gathering dust for the past couple of years.

Now as I look back at my code, im rather embarassed by some of it. But, I have some more experince now and am
preparing to work on this once again.
