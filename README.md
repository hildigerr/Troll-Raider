Troll-Raider
************

Raid human villages for food and wealth, rescue your family members, and defeat troll hunting heros in this Roguelike game.

This began as my first attempt at a 7drl in the 2011 challenge. My main purpose was to learn to use curses.

I lost a baby-tooth chewing on this stuff: It was the first time I attempted parsing textual datafiles. When I began duplicating my parsing routine, I realized I should have made it generic. And then, I started thinking about all the rest of the places I could reduce code duplication. I became overwelmed and didn't finish in 7 days. Coming back after a couple years and looking back at the code, I was rather embarassed by it. I knew nothing about the design process, object oriented programming, nor version control. I'm **in the process of re-writing and completing it** now that I do.
